    "In this exercise, we will compute and visualize the magnetic anomalies of various geometric shapes (sphere, cylinder, block) below the surface of the Earth. We will see that, despite the differences in shape of these bodies, their magnetic anomalies can be quite similar. This will have implications for the measurement accuracy needed to infer the geometry of a magnetized body. Furthermore, we will apply Poisson's relation to compute the vertical density gradient based on the magnetic anomalies."
