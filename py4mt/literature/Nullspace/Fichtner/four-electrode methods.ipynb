    "2) Consider a new configuration where the detection electrode D moves down into a borehole instead of moving across the surface. For this, keep $x_C=2$ m, $z_C=0$ m, and set $x_D=-2$ m. Then let $z_D$ be a variable. Plot the measured voltage as a function of depth $y_D$ by modifying the above calculations. \n",
