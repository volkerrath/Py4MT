    "# Dislocation and diffusion creep\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we study the relative importance of the two deformation mechanisms dislocation creep and diffusion creep, which depends primarily on pressure, temperature and grain size.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we consider dislocation and diffusion creep in olivine, which is a major constituent mineral of the Earth's upper mantle. Both deformation mechanisms can be described by the rheological equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{\\varepsilon} = A \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu} \\right)^n \\left( \\frac{b}{d} \\right)^m e^{-(E+pV)/RT} $\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$ is strain rate, $A$ is a scaling factor, $\\sigma$ is stress, $\\mu$ is shear modulus (taken to be 81 GPa), $n$ is the stress exponent, $m$ is the grain size exponent, $b$ is the length of the so-called Burgers vector (0.5 nm for olivine), $d$ is grain size, $E$ is activation energy, $V$ is activation volume, $T$ is temperature, $p$ is pressure, and $R$ is the gas constant (8.3144598 J mol$^{−1}$ K$^{−1}$). For the two different deformation mechanisms, we adopt the following values, determined experimentally for dry olivine (see Karato, Geophys. Res. Lett. 19, 1992):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dislocation creep**: $A=3.5\\cdot 10^{22}$ s$^{-1}$, $n=3.5$, $m=0$, $E=540\\cdot 10^{3}$ J mol$^{-1}$, $V=20 \\cdot 10^{-6}$ m$^3$ mol$^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diffusion creep**: $A=8.7\\cdot 10^{15}$ s$^{-1}$, $n=1.0$, $m=2.5$, $E=300\\cdot 10^{3}$ J mol$^{-1}$, $V=6 \\cdot 10^{-6}$ m$^3$ mol$^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "'Dry' means that the olivine is not polluted by hydrogen atoms. When hydrogen is present (so-called wet olivin), the activation energies and volumes typically drop significantly, thus leading to larger strain rates for a given stress."

    "2) To study the grain size dependence, set the pressure $p$ to 20 GPa and let $d$ vary between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-1}$ m. Plot the strain rates for diffusion and dislocation creep as a function of grain size $d$. Below which grain size is diffusion creep the dominant deformation mechanism?\n",
