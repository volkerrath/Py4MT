    "The Earth's magnetic field is generated by convective motion in the liquid outer core. The nature of the magnetic field is characterised by long periods of stability, punctuated by abrupt reversals that remain poorly understood. To shed light onto the dynamics of outer-core convection, the evolution of the geomagnetic field needs to be reconstructed accurately.\n",
