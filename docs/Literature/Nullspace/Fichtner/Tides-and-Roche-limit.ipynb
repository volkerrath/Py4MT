We then replace the Moon by the Sun. This will allow us to compare the lunar and solar tidal accelerations on Earth, and to compute the Earth's Roche limit, i.e., the (hypothetical) distance between Earth and Sun at which the solar tidal acceleration would equal the Earth's own gravity."

Compare the solar and lunar tidal accelerations at the surface of the Earth.\n",
