The EM environment in Mini/Anaconda can be generated from the 
EM.yml file (exported from Volker's current working environment) 
by entering: 

conda env create -f EM.yml

or 

conda create --name Whatever-you-like --file EM.list

The former will create an environment named EM, unless you edit 
the .yml file.

Conda might complain about nonexisting packages. Simply delete 
the version information in the yml and repeat. There are a few packages 
which you may need to reinstall via pip, or from the sources, 
however, this is rare.


If this works fine, carry on with:

conda activate EM


If conda did not setup mtpy (usually it does), get the git repository (using the 
develop branch at your own risk) with:

git clone https://github.com/MTgeophysics/mtpy.git whatever-directory-you-want
cd whatever-directory-you-want
python setup.py install   or  pip install -e . 

That should do the trick. You can then test mtpy by calling

mtpy_tests.sh

Enjoy, 
Volker
