The Py4MT environment in Mini/Anaconda can be generated from the 
Py4MT.yaml file (exported from Volker's working environment) 
by entering: 

conda env create -f Py4MT.yml

or 

conda create --name Py4MT --file Py4MT.list

If this works fine, carry on with:

conda activate Py4MT


Then get your git repository (using the develop branch at your own risk) with

git clone https://github.com/MTgeophysics/mtpy.git whatever-directory-you-want
cd whatever-directory-you-want
python setup.py install

That should do the trick. You can then test mtpy by calling

mtpy_tests.sh

Enjoy, 
Volker
